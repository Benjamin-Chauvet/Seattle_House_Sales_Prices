# Seattle_House_Sales_Prices

This project has been led during my Economics Licence degree's last year using R and I was in collaboration with Damien Dubaut.

The `BDD_data.csv` dataset contains houses caracteristics such as the *living area (sqft)*, the *number of rooms*, the *built year* or the *location* and **selling prices** as the dependant variable.
The aim of this study is to explain house sales prices depending on property caracteristics.

During this project, we had to deal wtih **data preprocessing**, **descriptive statistics** and **econometric methods** (correlations, linear regressions, statistical tests).
